DivIDEo: Video encoder for ZX Spectrum + DivIDE interface
=========================================================

This is the video converter app for the DivIDEo project.
For the Spectrum player, and further info, see: http://divideo.zxdemo.org/

The latest version of the converter source code (licensed under GPLv2 or later)
can be found at: http://github.com/gasman/divideo

Instructions
------------
For a direct conversion at the default settings:

	divideo input_file.avi output_file.dvo

The resulting .dvo file can then be copied to your DivIDE-compatible medium of
choice, and played with the DivIDEo player. Video conversion is done through
the ffmpeg library <http://ffmpeg.org/>, so most sensible codecs and formats
should be supported (not just .avi). However, the input file's frame rate must
be 25fps, otherwise the video and audio will go out of sync.

For further conversion options (including switching mono/colour and
brightness/contrast settings), see:
	divideo --help
